            After my Associate Degree in Building Inspection, I worked in the technical office department of various projects in the construction sector in the field of exploration, cost, work schedule, progress payment and quantity. Due to my interest in the IT sector and software, I took every opportunity I found to improve myself in this field. In this context, I follow new technologies closely and continue to improve myself in this field with online trainings.

            I started working as a full stack developer as of November 2019, completely transitioning to the software industry, where I have been passionately involved and also doing some freelance work since 2010. At the same time, I finished the Computer Programming associate degree program, and I aim to complete my undergraduate education in this field.
